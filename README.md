mouseGestures
=============

This is a google chrome extension which enables basic mouse gestures for navigation, similar to the gestures included by default in the old Opera browser (RIP).

Forked from [miniGestures](https://github.com/ajribeiro/miniGestures) to include another user's bugfixes and remove buttcoin garbage.
